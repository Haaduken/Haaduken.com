# HAADUKEN!!

Welcome to Haaduken! This website began in early January of this year and was made with the intention to learn how to make a website from scratch, just me, a domain name, and a server. To think that I am already on the third iteration of what it looks like (granted version 2 existed for about two weeks before I scrapped it) in just 5 months is nuts to me. The former two versions are sitting in my github in a different repo from this one, since this one was a complete overhaul.
