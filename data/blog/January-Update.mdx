# Updates for the new Semester

Just a quick update was just pushed to the website, mostly updating course information and adjusting a few things here and there to look a little better as I have learned a bit more on this framework. One major change is the removal of some papers attached to the Portfolio page. They were there for a class requirement last semester, however I felt like it did not really belong where it was, so it has been removed. They may return in a future update, however for now they sit in archive.
